    "_CGOCollections_, as the name indicates are collections of CGOs, **C**ompiled **G**raphics **O**bjects.  In PyMOLViz this corresponds to every class that inherits from _Points_. This includes every class except for the ColorMap that has been presented thus far. However it specifically excludes any volumetric class. \n",

    "CGOCollections are _Displayables_ and have therefore a _name_ and a _write_ function. They are special in that all _Displayables_ that are part of a _CGOCollection_ will be combined and appear in PyMOL as the **same** _Displayable_ under the name of the Collection (unless they are also added by different means)."
